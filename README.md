## Features
:heavy_check_mark: Create a responsive interface to work on any type of screen (from smartphone to desktop screens), and also work on the most used browsers (Chrome and Edge). I can't test at safari, because it was discontinued to windows since 2012 and IE became Edge. 

:heavy_check_mark: Create an initial animation for the hero banner (feel free).

:heavy_check_mark: The listed prizes are dynamic and must be loaded from a json array. Create the structure for it and make work for the ones you see on mockup. We will play with this json array, changing, adding or removing prizes to see how your interface behaves.

:heavy_check_mark: When submitting the form, replace it by a “Thank you `<name>`” message (where the
name is the one provided by the user).

## Others features

:heavy_check_mark: I thought that wheel prize was suppose to be dynamic. Then I did the wheel with html/css, each slice is independent and can have their own behavior.
